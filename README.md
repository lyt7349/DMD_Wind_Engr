Introduction 
This computeDMD_wake_demo.m algorithm and sample data are based on the computeDMD.m algorithm from Kutz et al. (2016). To give full credit and for more details, readers shall refer to Chapter 2 of
Kutz, J. N., Brunton, S. L., Brunton, B. W., & Proctor, J. L. (2016).

This pedagogical example demonstrates a Koopman analysis via the similarity-matrix Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) on a prototypical wind engineering problem (though at significantly reduced Re for simplicity), the cylinder wake.
